## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed stations for missions that were saved before DCS had the neutral coalition
- Fixed crash (by upgrading dependencies) with latest DCS (tested to work with 2.9.19.13478)

## [3.1.2] - 2021-07-01

### Fixed

- Fixed ATIS stations for airfields that have a dot (`.`) in their name (e.g. Antonio B. Won Pat Intl on Mariana) [#103](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/103)

## [3.1.1] - 2021-06-22

### Fixed

- Fixed ATIS stations for airfields that have numbers in their name (e.g. H4 on Syria) [#97](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/97)
- Fixed ATIS on Syria for the latest DCS patch [#100](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/100)
- Fixed reported altimeter setting for the carrier and airfields close to sealevel [#85](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/85)

## [3.1.0] - 2021-05-05

### Added

- Added `NO HPA` ATIS station option. Each ATIS station with this option set omits the hectopascals from the remarks section (thanks [@talbotmcinnis](https://github.com/talbotmcinnis) for the implementation!) [#92](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/pull/92)
- Added `NO QFE` ATIS station option. Each ATIS station with this option set omits the QFE from the remarks section (thanks [@talbotmcinnis](https://github.com/talbotmcinnis) for the implementation!) [#92](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/pull/92)

### Fixed

- Fixed DATIS being unable to read floating point `thickness` and `base` values for old cloud weather setups [#95](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/95)

## [3.0.1] - 2021-05-02

### Added

- Added a 500ms break between the two different QFE reports (`QFE 2997 <break time=\"500ms\" /> or 1015.`) [#83](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/83)

### Fixed

- Fixed QNH and QFE for temperatures other than 16°C [#85](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/85)

### Changed

- Made the internal handling of different measurement units (like foot vs meter and pascal vs inHg) type-safe which should help to prevent measurement conversion-related errors in the future.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-04-25

The following list is a summary of changes of all previous beta releases, there were no changes since the previous beta `3.0.0-beta.3`,

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Added support for DCS 2.7 cloud presets. Requires DCS 2.7 from now on.
- Added Azure as an additional TTS provider [#90](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/pull/90) (thanks [ugene143](https://github.com/ugene143) for the implementation!)

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** The plugin settings have been removed from the DCS settings screen. DATIS is now configured through a config file at `Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Config\DATIS.json`, see [Settings](./docs/Settings.md). Existing settings are not automatically migrated. This has been done, because each mission you save contains all your plugin settings. This included the cloud provider access keys set for DATIS. The change has been made to prevent the accidential sharing of those credentials.

## [3.0.0-beta.3] - 2021-04-22

### Added

- Fixed carrier report to report correct magnetic BRC (by estimating the magnetic declination using the IGRF model). [#68](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/issues/68)

## [2.2.0] - 2021-01-22

The following list is a summary of changes of all previous beta releases, there were no changes since the previous beta `2.2.0-beta.7`,

### Added
- Added a new option to override the information later that an ATIS station starts with. Thanks a lot [@talbotmcinnis](https://github.com/talbotmcinnis) for the implementation! [#69](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/pull/69)
- Added support for all non-US (en_GB, en_AU, ...) English Google Cloud voices
- Added support for new English AWS (Polly) voices
- Added all possible Windows TTS English voices to DATIS default voice setting dropdown

### Changed
- It is now possible to set station options in any order and you'll now receive a useful error message for most kind of typos in the configuration, instead of that the station does simply not work. Thanks a lot [@talbotmcinnis](https://github.com/talbotmcinnis) for the implementation! [#73](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/pull/73)
- ATIS stations setup via the misison situation can now use all additional settings that were previously only available to the static unit setup method. Thanks a lot [@talbotmcinnis](https://github.com/talbotmcinnis) for the implementation! [#78](https://github.com/rkusa/DATIS/pull/78)
- Major version upgrades of internal libraries
- Rewrote the Lua module based on the excelent [mlua](https://github.com/khvzak/mlua) library. This removes all `unsafe` code from DATIS and allows to dynamically link against DCS' Lua dll instead of statically linking against Lua (which is discouraged for Lua modules).
- Rewrote the RPC between DATIS and DCS to directly serialize/deserialize Lua data structures instead of going through JSON.

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows TTS-based ATIS stations to support non US voices (e.g. en_GB)
- Fixed station deadlock on certain RPC errors
- Fixed RPC methods to not fail when receiving numbers with exponents
- Fixed carrier boradcast to say "ninety-nine" instead of "niner niner" when addressing all personnel dialed to the frequency #66
- Allow using neutral statics and units as ATIS/Weather/Broadcast stations #65
- Fixed BROADCAST stations for WIN and AWS TTS

## [2.2.0-beta.7] - 2021-01-19

- Fixed Windows TTS-based ATIS stations to support non US voices (e.g. en_GB)

### Added
- Added support for all non-US (en_GB, en_AU, ...) English Google Cloud voices
- Added support for new English AWS (Polly) voices
- Added all possible Windows TTS English voices to DATIS default voice setting dropdown

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2020-06-16
### Changed
- **Breaking:** Upgraded SRS protocol to 1.9.0.0 (requires SRS server version 1.9.x.x)

## [1.1.0] - 2020-05-24
### Changed
- Update shutdown procedure to gracefully shut down all stations instead of killing them

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows' TTS to try use an english voice by default
- Add Windows' TTS related logs to the DATIS.log file

## [1.1.0-rc.1] - 2020-05-17
### Changed
- Changed the internal implementation of how DATIS talks to Windows' TTS (from calling a .NET application to a pure Rust implementation that uses WinRT bindings)

### Added
- Added weather stations. Weather stations are similar to ATIS stations, except that they are not related to any airfield. Their report is pretty much the same, except the active runway and the traffic frequency. To setup a weather station, name a unit with the following pattern `WEATHER {name} {frequency}[, VOICE {voice name}]`. The station will report the weather the unit's position.

### Fixed
- Fixed broadcast stations to work with statics.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-05-13

No changes since the previous pre-release (`1.0.0-beta.3`), the following is just a summary of change since version `0.10.0`.

### Added
- Added default voice option to DATIS settings
- Units can now broadcast custom messages. Just name a unit with the following pattern `BROADCAST {frequency}[, VOICE {voice name}]: {custom message}` and the `{custom message}` will be converted to speech using the voice `{voice name}` and broadcasted over the `{frequency}`.
- Support for Windows' TTS as an additional TTS provider #24
- Possibility to select a voice for Windows' TTS (e.g. `VOICE WIN:David`, or `VOICE WIN:Zira`)
- Carrier ATIS (reports altimeter, BRC and Case variant to be used; eg.: `CARRIER Mother 250.000`)
- Support for AWS Polly as an additional TTS provider (implemented by @16AGR-Durham)
- The internals of DATIS are no based on async Rust. With that, DATIS does not create two threads for each ATIS station anymore (max. number of threads is now the number of cores available to the system).

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Upgraded SRS protocol to 1.8.0.0 (requires SRS server version 1.8.x.x)
- **Breaking:** Made `WIN` the default voice (instead of `GC:en-US-Standard-C`)
- Every unit can now act as an ATIS station (not just statics)
- Every unit can now act as a Carrier station (not just ships; not really a useful feature, just a side-effect)
- Start each airfield station with a random information letter #39
- Reworked how DATIS communicates to the running mission - DATIS now has a way to ask the running mission about updates (this RPC functionality handles one request every 2 seconds)

### Fixed
- Fixed wind speed unit (convert the m/s received from DCS to knots) #40
- In some cases stations stopped transmitting every ~0.5 secs should be fixed
- Restore consistent ~3sec pause between reports
- Fixed DATIS crashing MP servers
- Possibly fixed DATIS not picking up weather updates for missions with dynamic weather #16
- Derive a visibility value from cloud and fog weather settings (instead of using the visibility mission setting that never changes)

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2020-05-11
### Changed
- Reduced the frequency in which RPC requests from ATIS stations are handled inside the DCS hook of DATIS to one request every 2 seconds (it was one request every half second before). This change will slow down the initial start of all stations a bit, but shouldn't be noticeable otherwise.

### Fixed
- Fixed default voice for ATIS stations

## [1.0.0-alpha.10] - 2020-05-01
### Added
- Added default voice setting to DATIS settings
- Units can now broadcast custom messages. Just name a unit with the following patter `BROADCAST {frequency}[, VOICE {voice name}]: {custom message}` and the `{custom message}` will be converted to speech using the voice `{voice name}` and broadcasted over the `{frequency}`.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Made `WIN` the default voice (instead of `GC:en-US-Standard-C`)
- Made `eu-central-1` the default AWS region
- Every unit can now act as an ATIS station (not just statics)
- Every unit can now act as a Carrier station (not just ships; not really a useful feature, just a side-effect)
